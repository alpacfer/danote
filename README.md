# danote

Language-learning note-taking web app (Danish-first) with a browser frontend and local Python backend.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: web app UI
- `backend/`: Python API, NLP pipeline, and SQLite access
- `docs/`: product definition, API contract, version tracking, test plan
- `scripts/`: development helper scripts
- `test-data/`: seed fixtures and sample sentences

## Run Instructions (Placeholder)

Implementation scaffolding is not initialized yet.

Planned local workflow:

1. Start backend service.
2. Start frontend dev server.
3. Open the app in a browser and connect to local backend.

Concrete commands will be added once frontend and backend stacks are scaffolded.

## Reproducibility

- Lockfiles must be committed when dependencies are introduced.
- Environment/runtime versions are tracked in `docs/versions.md`.
